# DJ Applications

This is a suite of - well, more than one - applications intended to
help a DJ create playlists and control music in real time.

Hugh Fisher is the designer and programmer. Not being a musician,
he sometimes listens to Paul Wayper who would be the product owner
if you're into Agile.

Written in Python 3 and Qt5, running on Fedora Linux.


**Spellbook** is for building playlists.
Assumes you already have Rhythm Box and a music collection.

**Caster** will be for real time playback of playlists.
